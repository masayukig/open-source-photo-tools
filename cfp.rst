Open Source Photograph Tools Selection
======================================

Abstract
--------

We are taking a lot of photos with phone, compact and SLR cameras
everyday. And, we need to retouch photos and manage them. Here comes a
question. What is the best tool to accomplish it?

One solution is that using a proprietary software and/or services such
as Photoshop, Google photo, Amazon Photo etcetera. However, we love
open source software! :)

Now, there are lots of open source photograph tools such as GIMP,
darktable, Raw Therapee, digiKam, UFRaw, etc. We have a lot of
options. In this talk, attendees will get to know their basics,
characteristics and pros/cons.



Private Abstract
----------------

In this talk, I'll explain about their tools and show some
demos. Because that should be good to understand their tools for
attendees.

I think many of audience already use some proprietary tools
such as Google photo, Photoshop. So, I'll compare their proprietary
tools/services to open source solutions.
